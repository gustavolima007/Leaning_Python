Differences and Applications of List, Tuple, Set and Dictionary in Python



Lists: are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java).
Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python.

Tuple: A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas.
In someways a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects and repetition but a tuple is immutable unlike lists that are mutable.

Set: A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable,
mutable and has no duplicate elements. Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.

Dictionary: in Python is an unordered collection of data values,
used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.
Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.



List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary are the data structures in python that are used to store and organize the data in an efficient manner.
